# Simulations involving Poisson-Dirichlet distributions and a certain coupling

This is a collection of simulations involving the **Poisson-Dirichlet(θ) distribution** and an extension of the **coupling proposed by Schramm** in his paper on [compositions of random transpositions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0404356.pdf).

An [IPython notebook](https://github.com/petermuehlbacher/Poisson-Dirichlet/blob/master/PD(θ)-simulations.ipynb) is used for presentation purposes. Python code can be found there.
